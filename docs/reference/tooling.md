# GraphQL Tooling

One of the big benefits of the GraphQL Type spec is that it lends itself to great tooling.

This is a list of tools that make it easy to work with GraphQL (either generally, or specific to WPGraphQL). 

# GraphiQL
GraphiQL is an open source in-browser GraphQL IDE tool created and maintained by Facebook. It makes it easy to interact with and debug GraphQL requests and explore a GraphQL Schema.

Below is a list of various GraphiQL implementations:

* **[GraphiQL Desktop App](https://github.com/skevy/graphiql-app):** GraphiQL as an Electron desktop app 
    - FWIW, this is the tool we use for our documentation demos / screenshots. 
* **[WPGraphiQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphiql):** WordPress plugin that adds GraphiQL to the WordPress admin dashboard 
*
