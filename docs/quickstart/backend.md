# WPGraphQL Quickstart - Backend

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    This will be a resource to help folks get up and running customizing the WPGraphQL Schema. This will likely show how
    to build a custom plugin that extends WPGraphQL, and will show basics like adding Custom Post Types and 
    Custom Taxonomies to the WPGraphQL Schema, adding custom fields, adding custom mutations, overriding field resolvers and
    working with Authentication. This might also touch on Unit testing code that extends WPGraphQL :thinking:
